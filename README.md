# UFOs

## Overview of the project
This project is to create a website that provides UFO sightings information. There is so much data, so we will make multiple filters to see only the necessary information. 

## Results

There are input places where you can filter the data.

Input criteria(Date, City, State, Country, and Shape), click somewhere on the web page (Criteria does not have to be filled in all the fields). It will filter the data on the webpage as we can see below in the image.

You can clear the filters by reloading the page.

## Summary
A drawback of this webpage would be the position of the filter search. If we scroll down the page, we won't see the filter page, and we have to scroll up the page again. I would recommend setting the filter search position to be fixed for further development. In this way, we can always see and input criteria without going back to the top of the page. Furthermore, we can add filters for duration and comments. The duration column can be filtered by number, and the input word can filter the comments column.
